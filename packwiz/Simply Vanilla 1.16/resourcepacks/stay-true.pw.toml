description = "Stay True is a visual remaster of the current default texture-pack, I tweaked and changed a lot of  current textures that I thought needed it. The changes are not drastic and still fit perfectly with the current color scheme and textures of the default texture pack, many of these changes will add a lot more diversity, removing repetitiveness which in turn results in a more realistic and overall nicer appearance."
